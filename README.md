# metflicks
A clone of the Netflix front page created in HTML and CSS.

It's fully responsive and, in my opinion, improves on the original it's based on in a couple of ways:

- The section header logos are not cut off by the top of the screen in the default view.
- The styling of the table in the "Pick your price" section is more legible in mobile view.

All links / buttons redirect to the correct page on the actual Netflix site.
